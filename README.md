# LLM-GENERATED-TEXT-DETECTION
This project, developed by me, aims to address concerns regarding the misuse of large language models (LLMs) in education. The focus is on developing a model to differentiate essays generated by LLMs from those written by middle and high school students, with an emphasis on mitigating plagiarism and preserving academic integrity.

Key Components
Dataset: Curated dataset labeled for LLM-generated and student-written essays.

Text Processing: TF-IDF vectorizer used to convert textual data into numerical vectors.

Model: Random Forest Classifier chosen for its effectiveness in discerning patterns.

Training and Evaluation: Rigorous training on the dataset with evaluation using ROC AUC scoring on a validation set.
